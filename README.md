# Work-Day-Scheduler

Created a work day scheduler, to have a helpful and organized system for your tasks, plans, or meetings for the day. It also specifically targets the traditional work day hours, 9am to 5pm. With this simple site there are rows, each row dedicated to one hour, with the time it is for, a text box for you to type, and a save button. In the text area you can type whatever you please, whatever you want to dedicate this hour of your work day for, then follow by a blue button, the save button. With the save button it will save into your local storage, now the events planned for the day will remain on your personal calendar site to come back to whenever.
